# StyleMods

### A growing library of customizable content styles, colors, utilities, components and icons with over 500 different style modules that can be compiled individually or together in 1000s of different combinations.

The styles are designed cohesively to provide consistency if using them together, they can be used as Sass modules in custom style sheets or compiled using a pre-configured framework with both methods offering the option to compile the styles using cascade layers if required.

The Sass methods and language used tries to stay user-friendly to make both options straight forward to use, and only CSS methods considered baseline by [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Baseline/Compatibility) have been used. Colored components have been tested with [Wave evaluation tools](https://wave.webaim.org/) to check for sufficient text contrast-ratios but will require re-validating if customizing the colors.

## Documentation [[stylemods.com]](https://stylemods.com)

As a single developer the website by far takes the most time to maintain so although I've done my best to provide consistent documentation that's up-to-date there's bound to be some errors. The repository for the website is private so please email at the address below with any feedback regarding issues.

## Feedback/contribute

As a solo hobbyist my primary goal is learning so any feedback regarding any of the styles or website as mentioned above would be highly welcomed. I'm pretty open to the idea of having others contribute to the project if anyone was interested, but it's not something I've put a lot of thought into as no-one has ever approached me regarding anything about StyleMods, nor issues or ideas shared via the repository.

Being old fashioned email to philbrown.canberra@gmail.com is much preferred if you wanted to contact me but I've also now enabled the discussions board so you're welcome to use it, or you can still open an issue if you prefer.
